    <h1>Women Empowerment</h1>
    <br>

    <p>Women Empowerment is empowering the women to take their own decisions for their personal development
         as well as social development.<br>
         Empowerment of women would mean encouraging women to be self-reliant, independent
         ,have positive self and so on.
         <br>
         We know that education is an essential tool to empower women to gain confidence and achieve economic stability and success.  In today’s digital era that has been largely defined by technological advancements, access to technology is essential to anyone’s educational and economic success.
    
         Women’s empowerment can be defined to promoting women’s sense of self-worth, their ability to determine their own choices, and their right to influence social change for themselves and others.

         It is closely aligned with female empowerment – a fundamental human right that’s also key to achieving a more peaceful, prosperous world.</p>
         
         
         <br><p>In Western countries, female empowerment is often associated with specific phases of the women’s rights movement in history. This movement tends to be split into three waves, the first beginning in the 19th and early 20th century where suffrage was a key feature. The second wave of the 1960s included the sexual revolution and the role of women in society. Third wave feminism is often seen as beginning in the 1990s.</p>
         <br>
         
         <p>Women’s empowerment and promoting women’s rights have emerged as a part of a major global movement and is continuing to break new ground in recent years. Days like International Women’s Empowerment Day are also gaining momentum.
         
         But despite a great deal of progress, women and girls continue to face discrimination and violence in every part of the world.    </p>
         <h2>Literacy is Empowerment</h2>
         <p> Female literacy rate stands at 70.3% as compared to global average female literacy rate of 79% (as per UNESCO).27-Sept-2022
            <br>We have seen massive growth year by year which encourage us for women empowerment.
         </p>
         <p>There are several factors that influence poorer literacy rates in women as compared to men, the biggest and most crucial factors being inequality and sex-based discrimination. This discrimination pushes the girl child to either never be born (female infanticide) or the woman to be predominantly pushed into household affairs.

            Low enrolment rates, high dropout rates, social discrimination, unsafe public spaces, prioritizing boy child education are some other important factors that negatively influence female education.
            
           </p>

           <h3>This shows high increase in literacy rate of women  which lead to women empowerment.
            Expecting more steeper slope in women literacy graph in upcoming years.
