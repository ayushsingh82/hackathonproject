    <h1>Ways to improve financial conditions of women</h1>

    <p>Since 2011, India has doubled the share of adults with a financial account to reach 78 percent. As discussed in the new Findex Note: India, this growth has also been equitable, as India’s gender gap has in that same period dropped from 22 percentage points to insignificant levels.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p>India’s growth in account ownership has been helped by various digital innovations and government sponsored schemes aimed at financial inclusion. The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY program) has proven to be a game-changer, not only for including a higher proportion of the population in formal banking channels, but also for reducing the gender gap in account ownership. Eight years after its implementation, more than 462 million accounts have been opened, 56 percent of which belong to women, and 67 percent of which are in rural and semi-urban areas.</p>
<br><br>
<p>Other data sources show a systemic gender gap in credit usage. According to a 2020 study, women in India receive credit equivalent to only 27 percent of the deposits they contribute, while men receive credit equal to 52 percent of their deposits. This discrepancy might be due to women not taking advantage of their credit history by applying for loans, and it may be that financial institutions do not grant credit equitably to women.</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Explaining women’s low access to credit and identifying ways to increase it
</h2>

<p>Low engagement and inactive accounts are possible explanations for women’s low credit adoption in India. Financial institutions often measure risk and assign credit in part based on an applicant’s transaction account history. However, account inactivity is high in India, resulting in fewer women having a meaningful account history with which to measure risk. The Global Findex 2021 finds a 12 percentage-point difference between women account owners who had an inactive account (42 percent) and men account owners who did so (30 percent) . Increasing financial usage overall could be a first step toward improving credit access.</p>
<br><br>
<p>A more gender-sensitive approach would call for wider representation of women at all levels. In addition to hiring more women in frontline roles such as business correspondent agents, India would benefit from having more women in senior decision-making positions driving gender-responsive financial products and systems.</p>

<h3>Taking the next steps</h3>

<p>Giving women borrowers in India the ‘credit’ that they deserve requires a comprehensive ecosystem that promotes convenience, provides gender-appropriate modes of engagement, and considers the broader needs of women’s lives and businesses. This could lead not only to greater credit to women, but also to improved outcomes for society.</p>
